# OwnAgent
 AI-based Task Automation System

## Overview
OwnAgent is an advanced AI-based task automation system designed to learn from user interactions. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to meticulously record and replicate keyboard and mouse activities, distinguishing dynamic elements and storing these interactions in a JSON format. When prompted, the system utilizes AI to dynamically adapt and replicate the recorded actions based on new instructions.

## OS Supported
Windows and Linux

## User Interface
Prototype UI: Developed using Python Eel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Workflow
- Show a demo of a task to the system.
- Identify the dynamic content.
- Save your demo with a proper description.
- Command the system to perform a task based on prompt.
- The system analyzes the prompt and decides what task to perform.
- It generates the dynamic content and performs the tasks utilizing AI-Agents(using crewAI framework)
